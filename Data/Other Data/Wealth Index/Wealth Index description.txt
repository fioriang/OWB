WOODS & POOLE ECONOMICS WEALTH INDEX

is a measure of relative total personal income per capita weighted by the source of income. The WI is the weighted average of regional income per capita divided by US
income per capita (80% of the index); plus the regional proportion of income from dividends/ interest/rent divided by the U.S proportion (10% of the index); plus the US 
proportion of income from transfers divided by the regional proportion (10% of the index). Thus relative income per capita is weighted positevely for a relatively high proportion 
of income from dividends, interest, and rent, and negatively for a relative high proportion of income from transfer payments. Because the imputed rent of owner-occupied homes is included in renal income
Since dividends, interest and rent income are a good indicator of assets the Woods and Poole Wealth Index attempts to measure relative wealth.
