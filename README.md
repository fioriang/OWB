In this repository, we provide all the data and necessary information for replication of our paper titled "Of the first five US states with food waste bans, Massachusetts alone reduces landfilled waste".  
We include all the raw data and software we used to produce all tables and figures in this paper. Additionally, various outputs generated by our code, such as power analysis results, are available in the "Data from Code" section.

# Data 

## Raw data 

1. Waste data: includes all the data we use for our analysis (power2_impexp.csv) Note: in this file "disposal" refers to state-generated MSW for disposal. That is, we have (i) used only the MSW fraction of the total waste and (ii) excluded the imported waste and included waste exports. (For more details, please see sections A.1.2 and A.1.3 of the SM).
2. Waste characterizations data:  (wcs_2.csv)
3. Food waste generators lists: (food_generators_MA.csv & food_generators_VT.csv)
4. Food waste processors lists: (food_processors_list_MA.csv & food_processors_list_VT.csv, composting_infrastructure_all_states_gov.csv, composting_capacity_all_states.csv)
5. Other data:   
   a. Population of US counties: needed to create the per capita waste dispsosal (population.csv)   
   b. US Cities: coordinates of US cities---needeed to estimate the minimum distance between generators and processors (uscities.csv)

## Intermediate data
These files include intermediate data that have been produced at midpoints in the code. For exact reproduction of the paper's figures, please use these files (when indicated in the code).

1. All State Level Results [found in xy.R] (xy_plot_data.csv)

2. Expected effects [found in xy.R] (composting_effect.csv, disposal_effect.csv, disposal_effect_size.csv, municipal_effect.csv)
   
3. Power results [found in placebo_all.RMD] (power_county.csv, power_state.csv, sf_power.csv);
   County-level power results: (plac_for_histogram1--6.csv);
   State-level power results: (power_state_plac.csv, pool_estimates_All.csv);
   Composting power results: (plac_for_histogram_composting.csv);
   

5. MAPE/MAE of placebo [found in placebo_all.RMD] 
   mae_placebo;
   mape_state;
   
6. Alternative methods [found in lasso_disposal.RMD & ridge_disposal.RMD] (all files starting with lasso_ or ridge_)

7. Average Treatment effects results [found in placebo_all.RMD] 
   County-level (treat_county.csv, treat_pool_county.csv);
   State-level (treat_state.csv);
   Composting (tr_res_state_multiple_composting.csv, tr_res_multiple_composting.csv);
   Backdated treatment(treat_state_passage.csv, treat_county_passage.csv);
   City-level (sf_power.csv, plac_sf.csv, tr_res_municipal_multiple.csv)

# Code

## Primary analysis
1. placebo_all.RMD: includes all the code for calculating the placebo confidence interval ("power") (left panel of Fig. 2, left panel of Fig. S7, left panel of Fig. S9, Table S6)
2. xy.R: main results and plots for effects of the bans (right panel of Fig. 2, right panel of Fig. S7)
## Data section
1. data_section: producing all the data-related figures and tables (Fig. 1, Fig. S2, Fig. S3, Table S4)
2. WCS: contains all information regarding waste composition and the expected effects of the bans (Table 1, Fig. S1, Fig. S4)
2. data_section_basic_manipulations: all manipulations to the raw data received from states (this produces the power2_impexp.csv file)
## Mechanism
1. infrastructure_gov.R: producing all the data-related figures and tables (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Table S9)

## Robustness checks
1. year_placebo: produces results for California-specific provision (Fig. S8)
2. composting: all analyses regarding bans's effects on composting (Fig. S10)
3. ghg: all analyses regarding emissions (Fig. S5, Fig. S6, Table S8)
4. xy_passage: all analyses regarding bans's anticipation effects (right panel of Fig. S9)
5. diff_in_diff: all analyses for difference in differences specification (Table S7)
