In this repository, we provide all the data and necessary information for replication of our paper titled "Of the first five US states with food waste bans, Massachusetts alone reduces landfilled waste".  
We include all the raw data and software we used to produce all tables and figures in this paper. Additionally, various outputs generated by our code, such as power analysis results, are available in the "Data from Code" section.

# Data 

## Raw data 

1. Waste data: includes all the data we use for our analysis (power2_impexp.csv) Note: in this file "disposal" refers to state-generated MSW for disposal. That is, we have (i) used only the MSW fraction of the total waste and (ii) excluded the imported waste and included waste exports. (For more details, please see sections A.1.2 and A.1.3 of the SM).
2. Waste characterizations data:  (wcs_2.csv)
3. Food waste generators lists: (food_generators_MA.csv & food_generators_VT.csv)
4. Food waste processors lists: (food_processors_list_MA.csv & food_processors_list_VT.csv, composting_infrastructure_all_states_gov.csv)
5. Other data:   
   a. Population of US counties: needed to create the per capita waste dispsosal (population.csv)   
   b. US Cities: coordinates of US cities---needeed to estimate the minimum distance between generators and processors (uscities.csv)

## Intermediate data
These files include intermediate data that have been produced at midpoints in the code. For exact reproduction of the paper's figures, please use these files (when indicated in the code).

1. All State Level Results [found in xy.R] (xy_plot_data.csv)

2. Expected effects [found in xy.R] (composting_effect.csv, disposal_effect.csv, disposal_effect_size.csv, municipal_effect.csv)
   
3. Power results [found in placebo_all.RMD] (power_county.csv, power_state.csv, sf_power.csv);
   County-level power results: (plac_for_histogram1--6.csv);

8. Year Placebo [found in year_placebo.R] 
   year_placebo

## Other data 
1. Population (population.csv)
2. Other controls for determining correlates of waste disposal [cross_sectional_variation_2.RMD]

# Code

## Primary analysis
1. placebo_all.RMD: includes all the code for calculating the placebo confidence interval ("power") and estimating the average ATT ("treated") (Fig. S4, Fig. 2)
2. xy.R: main results and plots for effects of the bans (Fig. 2, Fig. S5)
## Robustness checks
1. year_placebo: produces results for California-specific provision (Fig. S6)
2. composting: all analyses regarding bans's effects on composting (Fig. S8)
3. ghg: all analyses regarding emissions (Section B.1.6, Fig. S9, Table S7, Fig. S10)
4. xy_passage: all analyses regarding bans's anticipation effects (Fig. S7)
5. diff_in_diff: all analyses for difference in differences specification (Table S6)
## Data section
1. data_section: producing all the data-related figures and tables (Fig. 1, Table S1, Fig. S1)
2. WCS: contains all information regarding waste composition (Fig. S2, Fig. S3)
3. cross_sectional_variation: all analyses regarding determinants of waste (Section A.1.1, Table S3)
4. data_section_basic_manipulations: all manipulations to the raw data received from states (this produces the power2_impexp.csv file)
